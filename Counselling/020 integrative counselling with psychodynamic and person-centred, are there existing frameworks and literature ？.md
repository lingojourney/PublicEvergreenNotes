Yes, there are existing frameworks and literature that explore integrative counselling, combining psychodynamic and person-centred approaches. Integrative counselling is a tailored therapeutic approach that draws upon multiple modalities to suit the needs of the client. It often involves blending relevant theories and interventions to create a model that reflects the counsellor's theoretical and philosophical viewpoint¹.

The literature suggests that integrative counselling can offer a flexible and dynamic approach to therapy, allowing therapists to consider their theoretical perspectives and create a model that works for their practice. This approach can be particularly useful for clients who favor a mixture of behavioral and relational approaches¹.

In terms of frameworks, integrative counselling may include elements of person-centred therapy, which focuses on the client rather than the counsellor being the expert, aiming to help the client reach their full potential through acceptance and valuing, honesty and transparency, and offering unconditional positive regard².

Additionally, it may draw on psychodynamic therapy, which involves helping clients bring their subconscious thoughts and feelings into their conscious mind, becoming more aware of deep-rooted feelings and how they impact the present².

For more detailed information on integrative counselling frameworks and literature, you can refer to resources provided by counselling educational platforms and professional associations that discuss the integration of different modalities, including psychodynamic and person-centred therapies¹²³⁴⁵.
