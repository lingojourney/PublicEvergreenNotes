## How do I look at feedback from the lens of Naikan and NVC? üåø

Naikan and Nonviolent Communication (NVC) are both powerful tools for self-reflection and communication. Here is how you can look at feedback from the lens of both:

1. **Self-Reflection**: Naikan is a Japanese method of introspection. It involves asking yourself three questions: What have I received from X? What have I given to X? What troubles and difficulties have I caused X? When receiving feedback, apply these questions to understand the other person's perspective.

2. **Empathy**: NVC emphasizes empathy in communication. It encourages understanding and acknowledging other people's feelings and needs without judgment. When assessing feedback, try to empathize with the person giving it - what could be their feelings or needs that led them to this feedback?

3. **Focus on Needs not Judgement**: In NVC, we focus on expressing our own feelings and needs rather than making judgments about others' behaviors. So, when evaluating feedback, separate the person‚Äôs actions from their intentions or character traits.

4. **Expressing Gratitude**: An important part of Naikan is expressing gratitude for what we have received from others whether it's positive or negative feedback.

5. **Connection over Correction**: Both Naikan and NVC emphasize connection with others rather than correcting them or proving them wrong. When you receive feedback, remember it's an opportunity for connection, learning and growth.

6. **Taking Responsibility**: Both methods encourage taking responsibility for our actions rather than blaming others. This means owning up to your actions that might have led to negative feedback.

7. **Soliciting Feedback**: In line with the practices of Naikan and NVC, actively solicit feedback as a way of understanding how your actions affect others; it‚Äôs also an opportunity for personal growth.

8. **Clarity in Communication**: NVC promotes clear expression of our needs without using vague or judgmental language - so apply this when providing your own feedback.

In conclusion, both Naikan and NVC can foster a more constructive, empathetic approach to handling feedback. By engaging in self-reflection, expressing gratitude, connecting with others, taking responsibility for our actions, and communicating clearly and non-judgmentally, we can create healthier relationships and more productive conversations.
