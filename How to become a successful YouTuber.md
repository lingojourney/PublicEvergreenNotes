Becoming a successful YouTuber is no overnight journey. It requires patience, hard work, creativity, and an understanding of what the audience wants. Here is a guide on how you can establish and grow your own YouTube channel.

1. Define Your Purpose:
Before you start, it's crucial to ask yourself why you want to become a YouTube creator. Is it for fame, money, passion for a certain topic, or simply because you enjoy creating videos? Your purpose will guide your content strategy and keep you motivated during tough times.

2. Identify Your Niche:
Once you've defined your purpose, identify your niche. This involves determining what kind of content you want to create and who your target audience is. Having a specific niche will help set you apart from other YouTubers.

3. Create High-Quality Content:
The quality of your content is what will attract viewers and keep them coming back for more. Invest in good recording equipment - this doesn't necessarily mean the most expensive gear but ones that can produce clear audio and visuals.

4. Be Consistent:
Consistency in posting videos is key to growing your channel's visibility and subscriber base. Create a schedule for uploading videos and stick to it.

5. Engage with Your Audience:
Engaging with your audience builds community around your channel. Respond to comments on your videos, ask viewers for their opinions or suggestions in video captions or during the video itself.

6. Optimize Your Videos for SEO:
YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google. Therefore, optimizing your videos by using relevant keywords in the title, description, and tags can help increase visibility on both YouTube search results and Google.

7. Promote Your Channel:
Promote your channel on other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to reach more people beyond YouTube users.

8. Monitor Your Analytics:
By monitoring analytics such as watch time, viewer demographics, views by geography etc., you can understand what’s working well (and not so well) on your channel which will help improve future content.

9. Collaborate with Other YouTubers: 
Collaborating with other creators can help expose new audiences to both parties involved - making it beneficial for everyone!

10. Be Patient: 
Lastly but most importantly - patience! Building a successful YouTube channel takes time so don’t get discouraged if growth seems slow initially.

Remember that success doesn’t happen overnight – keep creating compelling content regularly while engaging with viewers genuinely! With time and consistency, anyone has the potential to become a successful YouTuber.
