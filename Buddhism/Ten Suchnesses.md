## Ten Suchnesses
The following definitions are given by the Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_suchnesses#cite_note-22) and describe what each suchness means in more detail:

- Appearance (form): the attributes of everything that is discernible, such as colour, shape, or behaviour.
- Nature (nature): the inherent disposition or quality of a person or thing that cannot be discerned from the outward appearance.
- Entity (embodiment): the substance of life that permeates as well as integrates both appearance and nature.

The above three suchnesses describe the reality of life itself. The next six suchnesses, from the fourth through the ninth, explain the functions and workings of life.

- Power (potency): life's potential energy.
- Influence (function): the activity produced when life's inherent power or potential energy is activated.

- Internal cause (primary cause): the potential cause in life that produces an effect of the same quality as itself, i.e., good, evil, or neutral.
- Relation (secondary Cause): the relationship of secondary, indirect causes to the internal cause. Secondary causes are various conditions, both internal and external, that help the internal cause produce an effect.

- ==Latent== effect (effect): the dormant effect produced in life when an internal cause is activated through its related conditions.
- Manifest effect (recompense): the tangible, perceivable effect that emerges in time as an expression of a dormant effect and therefore of a potential cause, again through its related conditions.

- Consistency from beginning to end (complete fundamental whole): the unifying factor among the ten suchnesses. It indicates that all of the other nine suchnesses from _Appearance_ to _Manifest Effect_ are consistently interrelated. All nine suchnesses thus harmoniously express the same condition of existence at any given moment.

## Explaining to a child v.2023-04
These are ten concepts that explain how everything in the world works. They are called the Ten Suchness. They are:

1.  Name and appearance: Everything has a name and a shape.
2.  Nature: Everything has its own nature.
3.  Substance: Everything is made up of something.
4.  Power: Everything has a force that makes it move or change.
5.  Action: Everything does something.
6.  Cause: Everything happens for a reason.
7.  Condition: Everything needs certain things to happen before it can happen itself.
8.  Effect: Everything that happens has an effect on other things.
9.  Reward: Everything that happens has a result, good or bad.
10.  Beginning and end: Everything has a start and an end.

These concepts help us understand how everything in the world works together, and how everything affects everything else around it.
## Explaining to a Java programmer v.2023-03-24
The ten suchnesses of Buddhism are a Mahayana doctrine which is important, as well as unique, to that of the Tiantai (Tendai) and Nichiren Buddhist schools of thought. The ten suchnesses are such an appearance, such a nature, such an entity, such a potential, such a function, such a cause, such a condition, such an effect, such a reward, and (from the first to the last of these) such an ultimate equality. 

I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. However, I can try to explain the ten suchnesses of Buddhism as an analogy to OOP. 

For example, we can think of 
- "such an appearance" as the class definition in OOP. 
- "Such a nature" can be thought of as the properties of the class. 
- "Such an entity" can be thought of as the object created from the class. 
- "Such a potential" can be thought of as the methods that can be called on the object. 
- "Such a function" can be thought of as the behaviour of the object. 

- "Such a cause" can be thought of as the constructor of the object. 
- "Such a condition" can be thought of as the state of the object. 

- "Such an effect" can be thought of as the result of calling methods on the object. "Such a reward" can be thought of as the benefits obtained from using objects in OOP. 

- Finally, "such an ultimate equality" can be thought of as all objects being equal in OOP.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## [[Explanation in the style of Marshall Rosenberg]]
[[Marshall Rosenberg]], the creator of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), might explain the Ten Suchnesses—a concept from Mahayana Buddhism—by focusing on the universal human needs and the empathetic connection that these suchnesses can foster. The Ten Suchnesses describe the reality of all phenomena, and Rosenberg might interpret them through the lens of compassionate understanding and the shared human experience.

Here's how Rosenberg might explain each of the Ten Suchnesses:

1. **Such an Appearance**: Every being and object presents itself in a unique way. Rosenberg would encourage us to observe without judgment, to see the beauty and needs expressed through these appearances.

2. **Such a Nature**: Each existence has its own essence and tendencies. Rosenberg might say that recognizing and respecting the nature of others helps us connect more deeply with them.

3. **Such an Entity**: Everything has its own distinct identity. In NVC, acknowledging someone's entity means acknowledging their feelings and needs.

4. **Such a Potential**: All beings have inherent capabilities. Rosenberg would likely emphasize nurturing potential through empathy and support.

5. **Such a Function**: Every being acts in the world in its own way. Rosenberg would suggest that understanding these actions as expressions of needs can lead to greater harmony.

6. **Such a Cause**: Causes are the reasons behind actions. Rosenberg would probably highlight the importance of identifying the needs behind these causes to foster understanding.

7. **Such a Condition**: Conditions influence outcomes. Rosenberg might explain that being aware of the conditions affecting us and others can lead to more effective communication.

8. **Such an Effect**: Actions have consequences. Rosenberg would encourage us to consider how our actions meet or don't meet needs, affecting our relationships.

9. **Such a Reward**: There are outcomes that linger beyond the immediate effect. Rosenberg would likely view these as opportunities to learn and grow.

10. **Such an Ultimate Equality**: From beginning to end, there's a fundamental sameness to all phenomena. Rosenberg might say that at the core, all beings have the same needs and deserve compassion.

In essence, Rosenberg would likely use the Ten Suchnesses to illustrate the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of meeting needs with compassion and empathy¹²³.
