In Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths (Sanskrit: चत्वारिआर्यसत्यानि, romanized: Chatwariāryasatyāni; Pali: caturāriyasaccāni; "The Four Arya Satya") are "the truths of the Noble Ones", the truths or realities for the "spiritually worthy ones".The truths are:

- dukkha ("not being at ease", "suffering",from dush-stha, "standing unstable,") is an innate characteristic of the perpetual cycle (samsara, lit. 'wandering') of grasping at things, ideas and habits;
- samudaya (origin, arising, combination; "cause"): there is dukkha (unease, disbalance) when there is, or it arises simultaneously with, taṇhā ("craving," "desire" or "attachment," lit. 'thirst').
- nirodha (cessation, ending, confinement): dukkha can be ended or contained by the confinement or letting go of this taṇhā;
- marga (path, Noble Eightfold Path) is the path leading to the confinement of tanha and dukkha.
