Exactly! Focusing on your **locus of control** means concentrating on the aspects of your life and practice that you can influence and change. Here's how it aligns with the principles of non-attachment and diligence in Buddhism:

1. **Direct Your Efforts**:
   - Apply your energy and efforts to areas where you have control, such as your actions, words, and thoughts.

2. **Acceptance of External Factors**:
   - Recognize that many external events are beyond your control. Accept them without resistance or frustration.

3. **Inner Transformation**:
   - Focus on your personal growth and ethical development. This is the core of your spiritual journey.

4. **Mindful Choices**:
   - Make conscious, deliberate choices aligned with your values and the Dharma.

5. **Self-Responsibility**:
   - Take responsibility for your reactions to external circumstances. Choose responses that reflect mindfulness and compassion.

By emphasizing your locus of control, you engage in **maximum diligence** in your personal practice while cultivating non-attachment to things outside your influence. This approach fosters a sense of empowerment and peace as you navigate the path. üå±üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
