In the context of the **10-world Buddhist model**, which categorizes ten states of life to understand the nature of our moods and character, the COVID-19 virus itself wouldn’t reside in any of the worlds because it’s not a sentient being with emotional states. However, the impact of the virus could be reflected in several of the worlds depending on how it affects individuals’ lives.

For instance, someone who is suffering from the virus might be in the world of **Hell**, experiencing great suffering. On the other hand, the desire to overcome the illness and the hunger for health and normalcy could place one in the world of **Hunger**. The compassion and efforts of healthcare workers to treat patients and the community’s support could be seen as expressions of the world of **Bodhisattvas**, where altruistic actions to help others are central.

[The **10-world model** in Buddhism is a framework for understanding the different states of life that one can experience, and it’s more about the human response to life’s circumstances than the circumstances themselves](https://www.sokaglobal.org/resources/study-materials/buddhist-concepts/ten-worlds.html)[1](https://www.sokaglobal.org/resources/study-materials/buddhist-concepts/ten-worlds.html)[2](https://sgi-uk.org/Philosophy/Principles/Ten-worlds).
