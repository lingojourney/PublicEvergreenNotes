Certainly! Here are two mnemonic versions to remember that 5 and 6 are controversial:

**Version 1:**
```
Five and six stir the mix,
In debates, they often fix.
```

**Version 2:**
```
When five and six take the floor,
Controversy's in store.
```

These mnemonics use rhyme and rhythm to make the concept memorable. The idea is that the numbers 5 and 6 are often found at the center of controversy, much like ingredients that stir up a mix or speakers that bring attention in a debate.
