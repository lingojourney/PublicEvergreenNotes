In Azure Pipelines YAML, to reference an earlier variable in a later one and perform string concatenation, you can use the `format` expression. Here’s an example of how you can define `myVar2` using the value of `myVar` and concatenate a string to it:

```yaml
variables:
  - name: myVar
    value: 'myValue'
  - name: myVar2
    value: $[format('{0}2', variables['myVar'])]
```

In this example, `myVar2` will be evaluated as “myValue2” during the pipeline run. [The `format` function is used within a runtime expression to format the string and concatenate ‘2’ to the value of `myVar`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68227021/get-current-timestamp-and-concatenate-with-string-in-yml-file)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68227021/get-current-timestamp-and-concatenate-with-string-in-yml-file).

Remember to use the correct syntax for the context in which you’re referencing the variable. [For more details on variable syntax and usage in Azure Pipelines, you can refer to the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops).
