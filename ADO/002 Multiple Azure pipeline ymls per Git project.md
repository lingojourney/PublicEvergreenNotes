Yes, you can have multiple YAML files for Azure Pipelines in a single Git project. This is useful for managing different pipelines for various components or environments within your project. Here’s how you can work with multiple YAML files:

1. **Create Separate Pipelines**: Each YAML file can define a separate pipeline. You can set up new pipelines in Azure DevOps and point each one to a different YAML file.
    
2. **Use Templates**: To share common steps between pipelines, you can create template YAML files and reference them in your pipeline definitions.
    
3. **Path Triggers**: Implement path triggers in your YAML files to run specific pipelines when changes are made to certain directories or files in your repository.
    
4. **Repository Resources**: If your pipelines need to use resources from other repositories, you can specify these using repository resources in your YAML files.
    

Here’s an example of setting up a path trigger:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  paths:
    include:
    - path/to/your/component
```

And here’s how you might reference a template:

```yaml
stages:
- template: templates/build-template.yml  # Template reference
```

Remember to ensure that each pipeline is configured correctly to work with the structure of your project and the desired CI/CD processes.
