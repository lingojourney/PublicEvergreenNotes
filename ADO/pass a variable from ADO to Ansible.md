To pass a variable from Azure DevOps (ADO) to an Ansible playbook, you can use the `extraVars` parameter in your Azure pipeline YAML file. Here’s an example of how you might structure your YAML to include the variable:

```yaml
- task: Ansible@0

  inputs:
    ansibleInterface: 'agentMachine'
    playbookPathOnAgentMachine: 'ansible/playbook.yml'
    inventoriesAgentMachine: 'file'
    inventoryFileOnAgentMachine: 'hosts.yml'
    extraVars: |
      "my_variable: $(VariableFromADO)"
```

In this example, `$(VariableFromADO)` is the variable you’ve defined in Azure DevOps, and `my_variable` is the variable name that will be recognized within your Ansible playbook. [You can then access `my_variable` in your Ansible playbook as you would any other variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59768155/how-to-use-azure-devops-server-tfs-predefined-variable-in-my-ansible-playbook)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59768155/how-to-use-azure-devops-server-tfs-predefined-variable-in-my-ansible-playbook).

For more complex scenarios or different configurations, you might need to adjust the method accordingly.
