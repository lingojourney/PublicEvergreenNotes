Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a method of communication designed to foster empathy, understanding, and connection between people. NVC involves expressing ourselves honestly, receiving others empathetically, and using language that is free from judgement or blame. 

Ken, from the Barbie series, can be used as an effective symbol of NVC for several reasons:

1. Open and Honest Communication: Ken is known for his open and honest communication with Barbie. He rarely harbors secrets or hides his feelings - a key part of NVC.

2. Empathy: Ken always shows empathy towards Barbie's feelings and situations. He listens to her without judgment and tries to understand her perspective.

3. Respectful Language: Even during disagreements, Ken speaks respectfully to Barbie without resorting to blame or criticism - another important aspect of NVC.

4. Positive Conflict Resolution: Whenever there's a disagreement or conflict between Ken and Barbie, they resolve it peacefully through dialogue rather than escalating the situation.

5. Willingness to Apologize: A significant part of NVC is being willing to admit when you're wrong and apologize sincerely - something that Ken often does in the series.

To see Ken as a symbol of NVC:

1. Watch episodes or read books featuring Ken's interactions with Barbie.
2. Pay attention to how he communicates with her - his honesty, empathy, respectful language.
3. Observe how they resolve conflicts together in positive ways.
4. Finally, notice how he takes responsibility for his actions when he makes mistakes.

In conclusion, seeing Ken as a symbol of Nonviolent Communication can help illustrate these concepts in an accessible way that resonates with people of all ages who are familiar with the popular character from the Barbie series.
