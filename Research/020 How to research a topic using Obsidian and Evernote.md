Researching a topic using Obsidian and Evernote involves leveraging the unique features of both applications to organize and synthesize information effectively. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### **Using Obsidian:**
1. **Create a New Vault**: Start by creating a new vault in Obsidian specifically for your research topic.
2. **Gather Resources**: Import or drag and drop your research materials into the vault.
3. **Make Notes**: Create individual notes for each resource, summarizing key points and ideas.
4. **Link Ideas**: Use Obsidian's bidirectional linking to connect related ideas across different notes⁵.
5. **Visualize Connections**: Utilize the graph view to see how your notes interconnect and to identify patterns or gaps in your research.
6. **Tagging**: Implement tags to categorize notes and make them easier to retrieve.
7. **Daily Notes**: Use daily notes to log your research progress and new insights¹.

### **Using Evernote:**
1. **Organize with Notebooks**: Create a dedicated notebook for your research topic.
2. **Clip Web Pages**: Use Evernote's Web Clipper to save web pages and online articles directly to your notebook.
3. **Take Notes**: Write down your thoughts and annotations within the notes.
4. **Use Templates**: Apply Evernote's templates for structured note-taking, such as project plans or to-do lists.
5. **Search Functionality**: Take advantage of Evernote's powerful search capabilities to find information quickly.
6. **Sync Across Devices**: Keep your research accessible across all your devices with Evernote's sync feature.

### **Combining Both:**
- **Export and Import**: You can export notes from Evernote as HTML or text files and import them into Obsidian for deeper analysis.
- **Complementary Use**: Use Evernote for initial collection and quick access, and Obsidian for deep dives into the material and connecting ideas.

By using both Obsidian and Evernote, you can create a comprehensive and interconnected digital workspace for your research. Obsidian's strength lies in creating a network of linked notes that evolve into a knowledge base, while Evernote excels at capturing and organizing information from various sources²³⁴.
