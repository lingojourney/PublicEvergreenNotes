Here are a few steps to switch between multiple GitHub accounts on a Windows machine. This involves configuring Git, which is the software that you use to manage your code and interact with GitHub, to handle multiple accounts.

**Method 1: Using SSH Keys**

You can configure Git to use different SSH keys for different GitHub accounts. This requires creating SSH keys for each account, then adding them to the SSH agent and to each GitHub account.

1. **Create SSH Keys**: Open Git Bash and run the following commands to create an SSH key for an account. Be sure to replace `YourEmail@email.com` with the email you use for the account.

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YourEmail@email.com"
    ```
    
    When you're asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

2. **Start SSH Agent**: Run the following commands in the Git Bash to ensure the ssh-agent is running:

    ```
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

3. **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent**: Add the newly created SSH key to the ssh-agent like this (if you used the default location for your key):

    ```
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub Account**: 
    - Copy the SSH key to your clipboard. If your SSH key file is named `id_rsa`, you can copy the key to your clipboard with:

        ```
        clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ```

    - Go to GitHub in your web browser.
    - Click on your profile photo in the top right corner, then click on Settings.
    - In the user settings sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
    - Click on New SSH key or Add SSH key.
    - In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal Mac, you might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".
    - Paste your key into the "Key" field.
    - Click Add SSH key.
    - Confirm the action by entering your GitHub password.

5. **Repeat the Steps for Different Accounts**: Repeat the steps for your different accounts, ensuring you use a different key file name for each one.

6. **Create or Modify the SSH Config File**: In order to tell Git which key to use for which domain, you'll need to create (or modify, if it already exists) the SSH config file. This file is located in the `~/.ssh` directory and is named `config`. For each account, you'll need to add an entry that looks like this:

    ```
    Host github.com-YourUsername
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_YourUsername
        IdentitiesOnly yes
    ```

    Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username and `id_rsa_YourUsername` with the corresponding SSH key file.

7. **Use the SSH Config in Git**: When you clone a repository, you need to modify the repository URL to use the host from your SSH config file:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com-YourUsername:YourUsername/YourRepository.git
    ```

**Method 2: Switching Users in Git Bash**

If you're not comfortable with the above method, you can manually switch GitHub accounts by changing the global `user.name` and `user.email` settings in Git:

1. **Set your username**:

    ```
    git config --global user.name "YourUsername"
    ```

2. **Set your email**:

    ```
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```

Please note that this method changes the global configuration, which means that all repositories on your machine will be affected. If you only want to change the settings for a single repository, you can use the same commands without `--global`, but make sure you're in the directory of the repository you want to modify.

**Method 3: GitHub Desktop**

If you're using GitHub Desktop, you can easily switch between accounts from the application:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on File in the top menu, then select Options.
3. In the Options menu, click on Accounts.
4. Here, you can sign in and out of your GitHub.com and Enterprise accounts. You can switch between them by signing out of one and into the other.

Remember, when you switch accounts, you'll need to clone your repositories again for each account, as your local repositories are associated with the account you were logged into when you cloned them.
