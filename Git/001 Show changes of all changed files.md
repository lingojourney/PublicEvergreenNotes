To show the changes of all changed files in a Git repository, you can use the `git diff` command. Hereâ€™s how you can see the changes:

```bash
git diff
```

This command will display the diff of what is staged and what is modified but unstaged. If you want to see the changes that are staged for the next commit, you can use:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

And if you want to see the changes since the last commit, regardless of staging, you can use:

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

These commands will show you the line-by-line changes made to each file. Remember, the output will be in the diff format, showing lines added or removed from each file. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with Git, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
