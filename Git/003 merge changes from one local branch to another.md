To merge changes from one local branch to another in Git, follow these steps:

1. **Check out the branch you want to merge into** (the target branch):
   ```bash
   git checkout target-branch
   ```
2. **Merge the branch with the changes** (the source branch) into the target branch:
   ```bash
   git merge source-branch
   ```

Here's an example of merging changes from a branch named `feature` into the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

This will merge all the commits from `feature` into `main`. The `feature` branch will remain unchangedÂ¹.
