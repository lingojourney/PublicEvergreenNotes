Stashing an unstaged (non-added) file directly using `git stash` is not possible. However, there are alternative approaches to achieve your goal:

1. **Stage the Changes First**:
    
    - Stage the changes you want to keep using `git add filename.ext`.
    - Then stash the remaining unstaged changes using `git stash --keep-index`.
    - This will stash only the unstaged changes, leaving the staged changes intact.
2. **Interactive Stash (Git 2.13 and later)**:
    
    - Since Git 2.13, you can stash individual files directly using `git stash push`.
    - To stash specific files, use:
        
        ```
        git stash push -m "named-stash" -- file2.cpp file2.h
        ```
        
    - You can then reapply that stash later with:
        
        ```
        git stash apply stash^{/named-stash}
        ```
