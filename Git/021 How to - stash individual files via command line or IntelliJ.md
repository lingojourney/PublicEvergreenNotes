Certainly! You can stash individual files using the command line or IntelliJ. Here are the steps for both approaches:

### Stashing Individual Files via Command Line

1. **Stash a Specific File**:
    
    - To stash changes for a specific file, use the following command:
        
        ```
        git stash -- filename.txt
        ```
        
    - Replace `filename.txt` with the actual name of the file you want to stash.
    - This will create a stash with only the changes from that file.
2. **Stash with a Custom Message**:
    
    - If you want to provide a custom message for the stash, use the `-m` option:
        
        ```
        git stash -m "stash-message" -- filename1.txt
        ```
        
    - Replace `"stash-message"` with your desired message.
3. **Stash Multiple Files**:
    
    - To stash changes for multiple files, list them all after the double dash (`--`):
        
        ```
        git stash -m "stash-message" -- filename1.txt filename2.txt ...
        ```
        
4. **Reapplying Stashed Changes**:
    
    - To reapply the stashed changes later, use:
        
        ```
        git stash apply stash^{/stash-message}
        ```
        
    - Replace `/stash-message` with the actual stash message you used.

### Stashing Individual Files via IntelliJ

1. **Using IntelliJâ€™s Git Stash Feature**:
    
    - Open your project in IntelliJ.
    - In the **Version Control** tool window, find the file you want to stash.
    - Right-click on the file and select **Git** > **Stash Changes**.
    - Provide a stash message if prompted.
    - The changes for that file will be stashed.
2. **Reapplying Stashed Changes**:
    
    - To reapply the stashed changes, go to the **Version Control** tool window.
    - Right-click on the stash you want to apply and select **Apply Stash**.

Remember that stashing allows you to temporarily save changes without committing them. You can later retrieve these changes when needed. Feel free to choose the method that suits your workflow best! ðŸ˜Š
