To create a detached branch starting from the very first commit in your Git repository, you can use the following steps:

1. Find the first commit's hash. You can do this by listing all commits from oldest to newest and picking the first one:
   ```shell
   git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
   ```
   This command will output the hash of the first commit.

2. Check out the first commit in a detached HEAD state using its hash:
   ```shell
   git checkout <first-commit-hash>
   ```
   Replace `<first-commit-hash>` with the actual hash you found in step 1.

Now you're in a detached HEAD state at the very first commit, and you can use this as your scratchpad.

Remember, if you want to keep any changes you make, you'll need to create a new branch from this state before switching back to another branch.

To create a detached branch in Git as a kind of scratchpad, you can check out a commit in a detached HEAD state. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, find the commit you want to use as the starting point for your scratchpad. You can use the commit hash or any reference that points to a commit, like `main` for the latest commit on the main branch.

2. Then, check out that commit in a detached HEAD state:
   ```shell
   git checkout <commit-hash>
   ```
   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you want to use.

Now you're in a detached HEAD state, and you can make changes and commits without affecting any branches. This will act as your scratchpad.

When you're done with the scratchpad and want to save your work, you can create a new branch from this state:
```shell
git branch scratchpad-branch
```
