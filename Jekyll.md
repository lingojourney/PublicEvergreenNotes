Jekyll is an open-source static site generator written in Ruby. It is a simple, blog-aware, and flexible tool that transforms your plain text into static websites or blogs. Jekyll takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats and renders them into a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

Jekyll is often used for personal projects, blogs, or organization sites. It also powers the GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

The main advantage of Jekyll is that it handles all the backend work and allows you to focus on the content and presentation of your site. Since it creates static pages, it generally loads faster than database-driven sites.

Features of Jekyll include:

- Simple: No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates. Your content stays yours.
- Static: Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown and creates a complete static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server.
- Blog-aware: Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.
- Free hosting with GitHub Pages: Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free.

In conclusion, Jekyll provides a simple way for developers to create fast-loading static websites while retaining the flexibility of dynamic sites. It's easy to use and offers great compatibility with popular version control systems like Git and hosting platforms like GitHub Pages.
