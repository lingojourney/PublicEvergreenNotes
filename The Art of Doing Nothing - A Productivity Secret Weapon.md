Imagine you've discovered a magic potion - one that can transform your day from sluggish to supercharged, from unproductive to ultra-efficient. A potion that doesn't require any exotic ingredients or complex rituals. What if I told you that this magic potion is real? And the main ingredient is...doing nothing. Yes, you read that correctly. 

Inspired by the teachings of Marshall Rosenberg and my personal experiences, I've found that sometimes the best way to get things done is by giving yourself permission to do absolutely nothing.

Now, you might be thinking, "But Ben, how does doing nothing equate to being productive?" All I ask is that you stick with me. I've found this approach to be a life-changing productivity hack, and I'd love for you to give it a shot.

## The Two Rules of Productivity 

Let's set the stage. When it comes to productivity, there are two rules I abide by:

1. I can choose to do nothing.
2. Or, I can choose to do something.

Sounds too easy? Let me explain.

When I decide to do nothing, I mean *nothing*. I sit in my chair, away from distractions, and stare at a wall. No phone, no books, no doodling - just me and my thoughts.

When I choose to do something, I work. I immerse myself in the task at hand, whether it's writing a blog post, editing a video, or studying for an exam.

## The Power of Boredom

This strategy works wonders because, let's be honest, doing nothing is incredibly boring. It's so boring, in fact, that work starts to seem fun in comparison. So, when you give yourself the choice between doing nothing and working, you'll find yourself gravitating towards getting things done.

## How to Harness the Power of Doing Nothing

So, how can you incorporate this strategy into your life? Here's a simple guide to get you started:

1. **Choose your time period**: This is the block of time during which you can either do nothing or work. I typically choose four-hour blocks, but you can adjust this to suit your schedule.

2. **List your tasks**: Write down a list of everything you need to accomplish during your chosen time period. This becomes your 'something' to do.

3. **Start**: If you don't feel like working, that's fine. Do nothing. Sit in silence, away from any potential distractions, and do absolutely nothing. In a matter of minutes, you'll find yourself itching to start working.

4. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle within your chosen time frame.

This method may sound unconventional, but it's like a magic pill that propels me into a state of ultra-productivity. It leverages our natural aversion to boredom, turning it into a tool for effective task completion.

So, why not give it a try? The next time you're stuck in a productivity rut, remember - sometimes, the best thing to do is absolutely nothing.
