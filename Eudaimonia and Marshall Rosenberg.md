Eudaimonia is a term that comes from ancient Greek philosophy, meaning "human flourishing" or "the good life". It is often contrasted with hedonia, which refers to the pursuit of pleasure and happiness. According to Marshall Rosenberg, the founder of nonviolent communication, eudaimonia is the natural state of being that arises when we are living in harmony with our needs¹. He defines needs as "the resources life requires to sustain itself" and distinguishes them from strategies, which are the specific ways we try to meet our needs. For example, a need could be connection, while a strategy could be calling a friend. Rosenberg argues that when we focus on our needs rather than our strategies, we are more likely to experience eudaimonia, because we are more open to finding creative and mutually satisfying ways of meeting our needs with others. He also suggests that eudaimonia is enhanced when we express our feelings and needs honestly and empathically, and when we listen to others with the same intention². Rosenberg's view of eudaimonia is influenced by his background in humanistic psychology, which emphasizes the innate potential of human beings for growth, meaning, authenticity, and excellence³. He also draws on the work of Carl Rogers, who proposed that people have a natural tendency to actualize their true self, which is congruent with their inner experience. Rosenberg's nonviolent communication is a method that aims to help people communicate in ways that foster eudaimonia for themselves and others. ¹: Nonviolent Communication - Wikipedia ²: Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by Marshall B.
