On average, flu symptoms can last for about 1 to 2 weeks. However, some symptoms like cough and fatigue may persist for several weeks even after the initial illness has resolved. 

Cold symptoms, on the other hand, typically last for about 7 to 10 days. However, it is not uncommon for a cold to linger for up to two weeks in some cases.

It's important to note that these are just general averages and individual experiences may vary. Additionally, the duration of symptoms can be influenced by various factors such as overall health, age, and immune system strength.
