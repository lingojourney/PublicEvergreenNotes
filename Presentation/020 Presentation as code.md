Certainly! If you're looking to create a presentation using a markup language, you might want to consider using **Markdown** with tools like **Reveal.js** or **Marp**. These tools allow you to write your slides in Markdown and then convert them into a slide deck.

Here's a basic example of how you might structure a slide in Markdown for use with Reveal.js:

```markdown
# Slide 1 Title

- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

---

## Slide 2 Title

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

Each `---` represents a slide break in Reveal.js. You can add more formatting and even include code snippets within your slides. Would you like more detailed instructions on how to set up and use these tools?
