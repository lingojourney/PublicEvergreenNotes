The `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotation in Spring, provided by the Lombok library, is used to automatically generate a constructor with required arguments. Required arguments include any **final fields**, as well as fields marked with `@NonNull` that are not initialized where they are declared. This annotation helps to reduce boilerplate code by eliminating the need to manually write constructors for dependency injection.

Here's a simple example of how to use `@RequiredArgsConstructor`:

```java
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MyService {
    private final MyDependency myDependency;
    // other fields and methods
}
```

In this example, Lombok will generate a constructor that takes `MyDependency` as an argument because it is a final field. If you have non-final fields that are not annotated with `@NonNull`, they will not be included in the generated constructor.

Remember to add the Lombok dependency to your `pom.xml` to use this annotation:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.30</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Please ensure that annotation processing is enabled in your IDE to allow Lombok annotations to work correctly¹.
