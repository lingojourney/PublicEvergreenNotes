Hugging Face is an AI community that is building the future of machine learning. [The platform is where the machine learning community collaborates on models, datasets, and applications](https://huggingface.co/)[1](https://huggingface.co/). Hugging Face addresses the need for a central place where anyone can share and explore models and datasets. [They want to become a place with the largest collection of models and datasets with the goal of democratising AI for all](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-hugging-face-122f4e7eb11a)[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-hugging-face-122f4e7eb11a).

[Hugging Face has a proof of concept spelling correction model for English called **oliverguhr/spelling-correction-english-base**](https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/spelling-correction-english-base)[3](https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/spelling-correction-english-base). This model should fix your typos and punctuation. If you like to run your own experiments or train for a different language, have a look at the code[3](https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/spelling-correction-english-base).
