Let's compare the two formats for weekly habit trackers: habits as columns versus habits as rows. Below are the templates for both formats along with the pros and cons.

### Habits as Columns

**Template:**
```
Week of [Date]
--------------------
            | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
---------------------------------------------------------
Reading     | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
Exercise    | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
Meditation  | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
Language    | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
```

**Pros:**
- **At a Glance**: Easy to see daily habits and identify patterns.
- **Space Efficiency**: Compact and fits more information in less space.
- **Comparison**: Easier to compare performance across days for multiple habits.

**Cons:**
- **Overwhelming**: Can be visually cluttered if tracking many habits.
- **Details**: Less space for detailed notes or reflections.

### Habits as Rows

**Template:**
```

```

**Pros:**
- **Clarity**: Easier to focus on one habit at a time.
- **Details**: More space for detailed notes and reflections.
- **Customization**: Flexible for habits that need more or less space.

**Cons:**
- **Space**: Takes up more space, which can be less efficient.
- **Overview**: Harder to get a quick overview of all habits for a single day.

### Choosing the Right Format

- **Columns** are ideal if:
  - You are tracking many habits and need a compact overview.
  - You want to quickly identify daily patterns and habits.
  - Space efficiency is a priority.

- **Rows** are ideal if:
  - You need more space for detailed notes or reflections.
  - You prefer to focus on one habit at a time.
  - Customization and flexibility are important to you.

### Combining Both Formats

You might also consider combining both approaches. For example, use the column format for a quick overview and a separate, more detailed row format for a deeper dive into specific habits.

Ultimately, the best format depends on your personal preferences and the specific habits you're tracking. Experiment with both formats to see which one suits your needs best.
