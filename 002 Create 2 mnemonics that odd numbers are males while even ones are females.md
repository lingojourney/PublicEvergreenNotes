Certainly! Here are two mnemonics to help remember that odd numbers are males and even numbers are females:

1. **Odd Men Out**:
   "When the numbers go to dance, the **odd men** stand without a chance.
   They stand alone without a pair, while **even ladies** find their share."

2. **Even Eve's Odds**:
   "In the garden of math where the numbers roam, the **even Eves** find a home.
   But the **odd Adams** walk alone, in the numeric world they've sown."

These mnemonics use personification to associate odd numbers with males (men/Adams) and even numbers with females (ladies/Eves), making it easier to remember their distinct roles. Enjoy using them to recall the difference between odd and even numbers!
