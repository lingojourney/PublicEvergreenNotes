Certainly! In the field of psychotherapy and psychology, self-awareness is a crucial aspect. Let's explore some relevant tools and concepts related to self-awareness:

1. **Self-Awareness Multilevel Assessment Scale (SAMAS)**:
   - The SAMAS is a **new tool** designed for assessing self-awareness after severe acquired brain injury (sABI) Â¹.
   - It addresses the multifaceted nature of self-awareness by assessing it at different levels:
     - **Declarative**: Perceiving the "self" in relatively objective terms.
     - **Emergent**: Recognizing self-related information as it emerges.
     - **Anticipatory**: Being aware of potential future actions or consequences.
   - The SAMAS can be administered by cognitive/behavioral therapists with the involvement of a patient's relative.
   - It provides a holistic perspective, allowing accurate diagnosis of impairment of self-awareness (ISA) and better neurorehabilitation treatment planning.

2. **Objective Self-Awareness**:
   - William James distinguished between subjective and objective self-awareness in the late 1800s.
   - Objective self-awareness involves comparing ourselves to others and a standard of correct behavior.
   - Researchers Duval and Wicklund contributed to defining this concept.
   - It plays a significant role in understanding our behaviors, attitudes, and traits Â².

3. **Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS)**:
   - The SRIS is a self-report scale for measuring individual differences in private self-consciousness.
   - Psychometric properties of the SRIS have been evaluated using item response theory models.
   - It provides insights into how individuals reflect on their own thoughts and feelings Â³.

Remember that self-awareness is a skill that can be developed and strengthened through reflection and practice. Whether you're a therapist, researcher, or simply curious about self-awareness, exploring these tools and theories can enhance your understanding! ðŸ˜Š
