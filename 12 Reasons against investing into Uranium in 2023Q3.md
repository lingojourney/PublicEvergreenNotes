1. **High Initial Capital:** Investment in uranium requires a significant amount of initial capital. From mining to refining and marketing, the cost of entry is high and can be prohibitive for many investors.

2. **Regulatory Challenges:** The uranium industry is heavily regulated, with strict laws in place to safeguard against potential misuse. This means that any investment entails dealing with a complex regulatory landscape that can change at any time, posing potential risks.

3. **Environmental Concerns:** Uranium mining has a significant environmental impact, from habitat destruction to water contamination. As the world becomes more environmentally conscious, this could lead to increased scrutiny and possible sanctions against uranium companies.

4. **Geopolitical Risks:** The distribution of uranium reserves is uneven across the globe, which creates an inherent geopolitical risk. Any political instability in uranium-rich regions can have a direct impact on supply and prices.

5. **Nuclear Accidents:** The risk of nuclear accidents, such as Chernobyl or Fukushima, remains a constant threat in the uranium industry. Even perceived risks could negatively impact investor sentiment and result in drastic price fluctuations.

6. **Slow Growth Perspective:** The global demand for nuclear energy is growing slowly compared to renewable energy sources like wind or solar power. This limited growth potential may not provide the high returns that investors seek.

7. **Long-term Commitment:** Investing in uranium is generally considered a long-term commitment due to the lengthy process of mine development and production ramp-up periods.

8. **Difficulty in Disposal of Waste:** Uranium waste disposal is both environmentally harmful and expensive, adding another layer of complication for investors.

9. **Limited Market Liquidity:** Unlike other commodities such as gold or oil, the market for trading uranium is relatively small and illiquid which might make it difficult for investors to sell their holdings when needed.

10. **Public Perception:** Negative public perception towards nuclear energy can influence government policies towards this sector potentially leading to restrictive measures that could impact investments negatively.

11. **Renewable Energy Competition:** With increasing advancements in renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power, these alternatives pose stiff competition to traditional sources like nuclear power which heavily relies on uranium.

12. **Ethical Considerations:** Some investors may choose not to support an industry associated with nuclear weaponry proliferation concerns as part of their ethical investing strategy.
