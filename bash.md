### Bash Scripting: Understanding `${1}`

- **Definition:**
  - `${1}` is used in Bash scripting to reference the first argument passed to a script or a function.

- **Context:**
  - In the realm of Bash scripting, when a script is executed, any arguments passed to the script from the command line are accessible as `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc., with `${1}` denoting the first argument.

- **Example Usage:**
  - Consider a script named `script.sh`. When executed as `./script.sh hello`, `hello` becomes the first argument, and `${1}` within the script will be replaced by `hello`.

- **Practical Application:**
  - As a Java developer, understanding and utilizing script arguments can automate and streamline many routine tasks in your development and deployment processes.
  - Incorporating this in scripts aligns with Lean methodologies by reducing waste (in this case, manual input) and enhancing efficiency.

- **Advanced Note:**
  - When arguments may contain spaces or special characters, using `${1}` in double quotes, like `"${1}"`, ensures the argument is treated as a single entity, preserving the input integrity.
