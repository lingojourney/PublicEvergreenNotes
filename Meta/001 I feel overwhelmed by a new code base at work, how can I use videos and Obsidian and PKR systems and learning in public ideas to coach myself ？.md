Feeling overwhelmed by a new codebase is quite common, but there are several strategies you can use to coach yourself effectively:

1. **Videos**: Utilize programming tutorials and coding walkthroughs available online. They can provide you with a visual and practical understanding of different coding concepts and practices‚Å¥‚Åµ.

2. **Obsidian**: This is a powerful knowledge management tool that can help you organize your learning and codebase notes. You can create a network of linked notes, which can be particularly useful for understanding complex systems and retaining information[^10^]¬π¬π¬π¬≤¬π¬≥.

3. **PKR Systems**: Personal Knowledge Repositories (PKR) systems are designed to help you manage and retrieve information. They can be used to store snippets of code, documentation, and personal insights that you gain while working through the codebase¬π‚Å∑¬π‚Å∏¬π‚Åπ.

4. **Learning in Public**: Share your learning journey online. This could be through blogging, streaming live coding sessions, or contributing to open-source projects. It helps you to build a network, get feedback, and learn from others in the community¬π‚Å¥¬π‚Åµ¬π‚Å∂.

Here's a step-by-step approach to integrate these resources:

- **Start Small**: Begin with a small section of the codebase and use videos to understand similar concepts.
- **Document as You Learn**: Take notes in Obsidian for each new concept or part of the codebase you learn about.
- **Build Your PKR**: Organize these notes into a PKR system, categorizing information in a way that makes sense to you.
- **Share Your Progress**: As you learn, share your insights and questions with the community. This could be through blog posts, tweets, or even comments on forums.

Remember, the key is to be consistent and patient with yourself. Learning a new codebase takes time, and using these tools can make the process more manageable and engaging.
