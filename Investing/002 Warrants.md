The value of a warrant when the underlying share price changes can be complex to determine because it depends on several factors, including the intrinsic value and time value of the warrant. However, a basic understanding can be gained through the concept of **gearing**.

Gearing is calculated by dividing the asset price by the covered warrant price (adjusted for the conversion ratio if necessary). If an underlying share price is 100p, for example, and a covered warrant with a ratio of 1:1 is trading at 20p, the gearing is five times. [This figure measures the amount of additional exposure gained by investing in covered warrants rather than directly in the underlying asset](https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/covered-warrants-introductory-guide.pdf)[1](https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/covered-warrants-introductory-guide.pdf).

When the underlying share price falls, the intrinsic value of the warrant (if it’s a call warrant) would typically decrease. If the share price fell from 100p to 80p, the intrinsic value of the warrant would also decrease, assuming other factors remain constant. However, without specific details on the warrant’s strike price and expiration, it’s not possible to provide an exact value. [The time value of the warrant could also affect its price, as it accounts for the potential for the underlying asset to increase in value before the warrant expires](https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/covered-warrants-introductory-guide.pdf)[2](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-value-of-stock-warrants.aspx).

For a more precise calculation, you would need to use financial models that take into account various factors such as volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates. It’s always recommended to consult with a financial advisor or use specialized financial tools for accurate warrant valuation.
