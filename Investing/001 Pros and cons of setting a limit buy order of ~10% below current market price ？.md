Setting a limit buy order at about 10% below the current market price can be a strategic move with its own set of advantages and disadvantages:

**Pros:**

- [**Price Control**: You ensure that you don’t pay more than your set price, protecting you from overpaying during market spikes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp).
- [**Cost Management**: It helps in controlling costs, as you only buy the asset at a price you’re comfortable with](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp).
- [**Opportunity for Better Pricing**: There’s a chance to benefit from price improvements, especially if the stock price gaps down from one day to the next](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp).

**Cons:**

- [**No Guarantee of Execution**: If the market price never falls to your limit price, your order won’t be executed, potentially causing you to miss out on the trade](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp).
- [**Missed Opportunities**: In fast-moving market conditions, the price may quickly bounce back from the low, leading to a missed opportunity as the order might not get filled](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-limit-order.asp).

It’s important to weigh these factors based on your investment strategy and market conditions.
