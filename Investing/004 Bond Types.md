In the event of an issuer going into administration, **subordinated bondholders** are typically paid out last. This is because subordinated bonds are lower in priority compared to senior bonds when it comes to debt repayment. Here's the general order of payout in such events:

1. **Secured Creditors**: These are creditors who have a legal charge over a company's assets.
2. **Preferential Creditors**: This group includes employees for certain claims and, since December 2020, HMRC for certain taxes.
3. **Secured Creditors with a Floating Charge**: They have a charge over assets that are not covered by a fixed charge.
4. **Unsecured Creditors**: These are creditors without any security interest in the company's assets.
5. **Shareholders**: Paid last and only if there are any remaining funds.

Within the unsecured creditors, there is a hierarchy where **unsecured but preferential claims**, like certain employee claims, are paid before other unsecured creditors. **Subordinated debt** is often considered a form of unsecured debt that is specifically ranked below other unsecured debts; if there are any funds left after paying all other creditors, subordinated bondholders may receive a payout¹²³.

Therefore, between senior bondholders and subordinated bondholders, the latter would be paid out last. Senior bondholders have a higher claim on assets and are more likely to be paid out before subordinated bondholders in the event of liquidation or administration.
