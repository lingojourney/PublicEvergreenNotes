Certainly! **Hazelcast** provides a **command-line tool** called **Hazelcast Command-Line Client (CLC)** that allows you to connect to and interact with clusters on Hazelcast Platform and Hazelcast Cloud. You can use the CLC to execute commands through a terminal‚Å∂. Here are some details about the Hazelcast CLC:

1. **Hazelcast Command-Line Client (CLC)**:
    - **Purpose**: The CLC enables developers to use Hazelcast data structures, run SQL queries, scaffold projects, manage Viridian clusters, and more.
    - **Features**:
        - Interact with Hazelcast clusters.
        - Execute commands via the terminal.
        - Supports various use cases.
    - **Installation**:
        - **Linux / macOS**:
            - Use the install script for platforms like Linux/amd64, Linux/arm64, and macOS/amd64 (Intel or M1/M2).
            - Install the latest GA version using:
              ```
              curl https://hazelcast.com/clc/install.sh | bash
