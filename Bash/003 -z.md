In Bash, the `-z` string is used within a test or conditional expression to check if a string is null, that is, it has zero length. Here's an example of how it's used:

```bash
if [ -z "$string" ]; then
  echo "The string is empty."
else
  echo "The string is not empty."
fi
```

In this script, if `$string` has no value or is just an empty string, the message "The string is empty." will be printedÂ¹.
