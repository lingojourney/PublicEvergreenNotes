**Presenter:** 
"Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our lightly guided Morning Pages session. I'm Ben, and today we'll be spending ten minutes together, setting the tone for a mindful and creative day. Morning Pages is a practice popularised by Julia Cameron in 'The Artist's Way,' and it's a fantastic way to clear your mind, process your thoughts, and spark creativity. Let’s get started."

**Presenter:** 
"First, find a comfortable spot with your journal or a piece of paper and a pen. This is your space to write freely, without judgment or censorship. Remember, there's no right or wrong way to do this. Just let the words flow."

**Presenter:** 
"I’ll be here to lightly guide you through this process. Every couple of minutes, I’ll give you a gentle prompt to help keep the words flowing. Feel free to follow the prompts or ignore them and follow your own train of thought. Let’s begin."

**Presenter:** 
"Take a deep breath in... and out. Begin writing whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about grammar or spelling. Just let the words pour out."

**[Pause for 2 minutes]**

**Prompt 1:**
"Think about how you feel right now. Describe it in as much detail as you can. Are you feeling relaxed, anxious, excited? Write it all down."

**[Pause for 2 minutes]**

**Prompt 2:**
"Now, reflect on a recent experience that stood out to you. It could be something big or small. What made it memorable? How did it affect you?"

**[Pause for 2 minutes]**

**Prompt 3:**
"Consider your goals for the day. What are the top three things you want to accomplish? Why are these important to you?"

**[Pause for 2 minutes]**

**Prompt 4:**
"Think about someone who positively impacted your life recently. Write about how they influenced you and why you're grateful for them."

**[Pause for 2 minutes]**

**Presenter:**
"And that's our ten minutes! Well done for showing up for yourself today. Remember, this practice is all about clearing mental clutter and making space for creativity and clarity. You can revisit your pages later or leave them as they are. The most important thing is that you took the time to write."

**[Cut to: Close-up of a steaming cup of tea]**

**Presenter:** 
"Feel free to make Morning Pages a regular part of your routine. It's a wonderful way to start the day with intention and mindfulness. Thanks for joining me, and have a fantastic day ahead!"
