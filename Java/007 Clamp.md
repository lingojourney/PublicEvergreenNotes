.In Java, a clamp function is used to ensure that a value falls within a specified range. If the value is below the minimum limit, it’s set to the minimum; if it’s above the maximum limit, it’s set to the maximum. Otherwise, the value remains unchanged.

Java 21 introduces the `clamp()` method in the Math class, which simplifies the process of clamping a value. Here’s an example of how to use the `clamp()` method in Java 21:

```java
int clampedValue = Math.clamp(value, min, max);
```

[In this code, `value` is the number you want to clamp, `min` is the minimum value of the range, and `max` is the maximum value of the range](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clamp-function)[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clamp-function). If `value` is less than `min`, `clampedValue` will be equal to `min`. If `value` is greater than `max`, `clampedValue` will be equal to `max`. If `value` is within the range, `clampedValue` will be equal to `value`.

Before Java 21, you would have to manually implement clamping like this:

```java
int clampedValue = Math.max(min, Math.min(max, value));
```

[This line of code ensures that `value` does not go below `min` or above `max`](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clamp-function)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16656651/does-java-have-a-clamp-function).
