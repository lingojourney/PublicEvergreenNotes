If you're looking for a simpler solution without Spring, you can use plain Java to poll a directory for changes. Here's an example using `java.nio.file` package which provides a `WatchService` API to monitor directory events:

```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import static java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DirectoryPoller {
    private final Path dir;
    private final WatchService watcher;

    public DirectoryPoller(Path dir) throws IOException {
        this.dir = dir;
        this.watcher = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService();
        this.dir.register(watcher, ENTRY_CREATE, ENTRY_DELETE, ENTRY_MODIFY);
    }

    public void pollDirectory() {
        for (;;) {
            WatchKey key;
            try {
                key = watcher.take();
            } catch (InterruptedException x) {
                return;
            }

            for (WatchEvent<?> event : key.pollEvents()) {
                WatchEvent.Kind<?> kind = event.kind();

                if (kind == OVERFLOW) {
                    continue;
                }

                WatchEvent<Path> ev = (WatchEvent<Path>)event;
                Path filename = ev.context();

                // Here you can define the logic to handle the new file
                // For example, upload it to HCP

                System.out.println(kind.name() + ": " + filename);
            }

            boolean valid = key.reset();
            if (!valid) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path dir = Paths.get("/path/to/directory");
        new DirectoryPoller(dir).pollDirectory();
    }
}
```

Replace `"/path/to/directory"` with the path to the directory you want to monitor. This code will print out the event type and the file name whenever a file is created, deleted, or modified in the specified directory.

You can add your logic to handle the file, such as uploading it to HCP, within the `pollDirectory` method where the comment is placed.

This approach uses the `WatchService` API, which is part of the Java NIO package and provides a more efficient way to monitor directories compared to polling at regular intervalsÂ¹.
