To extract a list of attributes from a list of elements in Java, you can use the `stream()` method along with `map()` to transform each element into its attribute. Here's a concise example using Java 8 or higher:

```java
List<Element> elementList = // ... initialize your list
List<AttributeType> attributeList = elementList.stream()
                                                .map(Element::getAttributeX) // Replace getAttributeX with the actual method name
                                                .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

In this code, `Element` is your custom class, `AttributeType` is the type of the attribute you want to extract, and `getAttributeX` is the method that returns the attribute from an `Element` object. The `collect()` method gathers the results into a list. Replace `AttributeType` and `getAttributeX` with the actual types and method names that apply to your situation.
