Certainly! To import a list of environment variables in **IntelliJ IDEA**, you have a couple of options:

1. **Using Run Configurations**:
    - Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Go to **Run** > **Edit Configurations**.
    - Select your application configuration (e.g., the one you use for running your program).
    - In the **Environment variables** field, you can directly paste your list of environment variables in the format `-Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2`, separated by spaces.
    - Click **OK** to save the configuration.

   For example:
   ```
   -Da=b -Dc=d
   ```

2. **Using the workspace.xml**:
    - Alternatively, you can add environment variables to a configuration file and link it to your project by editing the run configuration of your application.
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Select your project.
    - Click **Edit Configurations** under the current file.
    - Tick the configuration to "Store as a project file."
    - In the configuration file, you can define environment variables.

   These steps allow you to set up environment variables in IntelliJ IDEA for your project. Whether you choose to add them directly in the run configuration or via a configuration file, IntelliJ will use these variables when running your application¬π‚Å¥.

Remember to replace `-Da=b -Dc=d` with your actual key-value pairs for the environment variables you want to set. üòäüöÄ
