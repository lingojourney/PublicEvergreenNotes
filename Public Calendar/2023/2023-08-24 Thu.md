## [[I wonder]]
- I wonder whether Power Bank is allowed in luggage. 
	- ðŸŒ¿ Yes, Power Banks are allowed in luggage but they must be carried in carry-on baggage only. They are not allowed in checked baggage due to their high capacity for energy storage. However, airlines have different regulations regarding the maximum allowed capacity of Power Banks, so it's important to check with your specific airline before travelling. 
		- Why is Power Bank dangerous when checked in
			- The main concern with Power Banks is that they contain lithium batteries which, under certain conditions, can catch fire. In the cargo area (where checked bags are stored), such a fire could go unnoticed and lead to serious safety issues. Therefore, for safety reasons, they must be carried in the cabin where any potential problem can be dealt with immediately.
