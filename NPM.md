NPM stands for “Node Package Manager” and is the default package manager for JavaScript’s runtime Node.js. It is also known as “Ninja Pumpkin Mutants”, “Nonprofit Pizza Makers”, and a host of other random names that you can explore and probably contribute to over at npm-expansions[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/). NPM consists of two main parts: a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/)[2](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

NPM allows JavaScript developers to share useful packages like lodash and moment quickly and easily. As of the moment I’m writing this post, npm has facilitated the publication of over 1.3 million packages with a weekly download rate of over 16 billion! These numbers are fantastic for any software tool[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/).
