The phrase "仏道に住せしむることを蒙る" (ぶつどうにじゅうせしむることをこうむる) is a classical Japanese expression that can be broken down grammatically as follows:

1. **仏道** (ぶつどう, Butsudo): "Buddha's path" or "the way of the Buddha."
2. **に** (ni): A particle indicating direction or purpose, similar to "in" or "to" in English.
3. **住せしむる** (じゅうせしむる, jūseshimuru): A classical Japanese verb form. "住せし" (jūseshi) is the past attributive form of "住す" (jūsu), meaning "to reside" or "to dwell." The auxiliary verb "しむる" (shimuru) indicates an action that is made to happen, similar to "cause to" or "let" in English.
4. **こと** (koto): A nominalizer that turns the preceding verb into a noun phrase, meaning "the act of" or "the fact that."
5. **を** (o): The direct object particle, indicating the object of the action.
6. **蒙る** (こうむる, kōmuru): A verb meaning "to receive" or "to be granted."

When put together, the phrase means "to be granted the act of residing in the Buddha's path." It implies receiving the blessing or benefit of being able to live according to the teachings of the Buddha.

This phrase is likely derived from Buddhist texts and expresses a deep respect and aspiration for the Buddhist way of life, suggesting that one is honored to be allowed to practice and dwell in the teachings of the Buddha¹.
