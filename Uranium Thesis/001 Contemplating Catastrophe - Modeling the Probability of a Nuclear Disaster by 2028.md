To analyse and model the probability of an uncontainable nuclear disaster by 2028, you would need to approach the task systematically. Here’s a high-level overview of how you might proceed:

1. **Define the Scope**: Determine what constitutes an “uncontainable nuclear disaster” for the purposes of your analysis. This could include factors like the scale of the disaster, the types of containment failures, and the potential for escalation.
    
2. **Gather Data**: Collect historical data on nuclear incidents, containment measures, and their success rates. This would involve researching past nuclear disasters, current containment technologies, and safety protocols.
    
3. **Identify Risk Factors**: Pinpoint the variables that could contribute to a nuclear disaster. These might include geopolitical tensions, the state of nuclear arsenals, the condition of nuclear power plants, and the effectiveness of international treaties.
    
4. **Develop a Model**: Create a probabilistic model that incorporates the identified risk factors. This could be a statistical model or a simulation that estimates the likelihood of various disaster scenarios.
    
5. **Run Simulations**: Use your model to run simulations, adjusting the variables to reflect different potential future states of the world. This could help estimate the probability of a disaster under various conditions.
    
6. **Analyse Results**: Interpret the results of your simulations to understand the range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities.
    
7. **Review and Update**: Continuously update your model with new data and insights to refine your predictions.
    

[For a more detailed and accurate analysis, you could consider using a **Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA)**](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1009_web.pdf)[1](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1009_web.pdf), which is a systematic and comprehensive methodology to evaluate the risks associated with nuclear power plants. PSAs are used to assess the likelihood of different accident scenarios and the effectiveness of the plant’s safety systems.

[Additionally, you might want to look into the latest research and discussions on nuclear risk, such as the **Nuclear War Risk Index**](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1009_web.pdf)[2](https://voices.uchicago.edu/202102bpro25800/2024/03/04/nuclear-war-risk-index-a-standardized-doomsday-clock/) [and the **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Doomsday Clock Statement**](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1009_web.pdf)[3](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/nuclear-risk/), which provide insights into the current state of nuclear threats and the factors that could lead to a nuclear disaster.

Remember, this is a complex task that involves many uncertainties, and the results should be interpreted with caution. It’s also important to consider the ethical implications of such an analysis and the potential impact it could have on public policy and perception. Always ensure that your work is grounded in the best available science and data.
