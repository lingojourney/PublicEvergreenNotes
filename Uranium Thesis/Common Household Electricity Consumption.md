The value of 273.9 Wh/h for household electricity consumption seems quite high for an average hourly usage. Let's look at some common values that might make more sense.

### Common Household Electricity Consumption

1. **Light Bulb**: A standard LED light bulb uses about 10 watts. If you have it on for an hour, it uses 10 watt-hours (Wh).
2. **Refrigerator**: A typical refrigerator might use around 100 to 200 watts. So in one hour, it uses about 100 to 200 Wh.
3. **Television**: A TV might use around 75 watts, which would be 75 Wh in an hour.
4. **Microwave**: A microwave might use around 1000 watts (1 kW), so if you use it for one hour, it uses 1000 Wh or 1 kWh.

### Average Household Consumption
On average, a typical household might use about 1 to 2 kWh per hour. This includes all the appliances and devices running in the house.

Let's assume a more realistic average:

- **Average Household Consumption**: 1 kWh per hour

### Recalculation with 1 kWh/hour

Given that:

1. **Capacity of Heysham 2**: 1240 MWe (which is 1240,000 kWh)
2. **Average household consumption**: 1 kWh per hour

### Calculating Supported Households
1. **Divide the total capacity by the consumption per household**:
   - \(1240,000 \text{ kWh} / 1 \text{ kWh/h} = 1,240,000 \text{ households}\)

### Conclusion
With an average consumption of 1 kWh per hour per household, Heysham 2 can support approximately 1.24 million households. This is a more reasonable estimate compared to the previous value of 273.9 Wh/h.
