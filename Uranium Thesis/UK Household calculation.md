The discrepancy arises from misunderstanding the capacity of the plant and the average household consumption rate. Let's go through the correct calculation step by step.

### Assumptions
1. **Capacity of Heysham 2**: 1240 MWe (megawatts electrical).
2. **Average household electricity consumption**: 2400 kWh/year.

### Converting Average Household Consumption
1. **Convert annual consumption to hourly rate**:
$$
 2400 \text{ kWh/year} = \frac{2400 \text{ kWh}}{365 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day}} = \frac{2400}{8760} \text{ kWh/h} \approx 0.2739 \text{ kWh/h} = 273.9 \text{ Wh/h}
$$

1. **Convert kWh/h to MWe**:
   - \(0.2739 \text{ kWh/h} = 0.2739 \times 10^{-3} \text{ MWe} = 0.0002739 \text{ MWe}\)

### Calculating Supported Households
1. **Divide the total capacity by the consumption per household**:
   - \(1240 \text{ MWe} / 0.0002739 \text{ MWe/household} \approx 4,528,767 \text{ households}\)

### Correct Interpretation
Given the total capacity of 1240 MWe and the average household consumption rate, Heysham 2 can indeed support approximately 4.53 million households, not just 4530. This aligns with the figure of supporting over 2.5 million homes during peak loading hours.

### Conclusion
The correct calculation supports that Heysham 2 can supply over 2.5 million homes, reaffirming that there is no discrepancy when the average household consumption is correctly applied.
