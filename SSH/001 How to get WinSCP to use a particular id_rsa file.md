To configure WinSCP to use a specific `id_rsa` file for SSH authentication, you can follow these steps:

1. Open WinSCP and go to the **Login** screen.
2. Enter your session details (host name, user name, port number).
3. Click on **Advanced...** to open the advanced settings.
4. Navigate to **SSH > Authentication**.
5. In the **Private key file** box, click on the **...** button to browse for your `id_rsa` file.
6. If your key is not in PuTTY's `.ppk` format, change the file filter to **All private key files**; select your SSH key, and WinSCP will offer to convert the key for you, saving a copy of the key in `.ppk` format¹.

After setting the private key, return to the **Login** screen and click **Save** or **Login** to connect to your server with the specified `id_rsa` file.

If you need to convert your `id_rsa` file to PuTTY's `.ppk` format manually, you can use PuTTYgen:
1. Open PuTTYgen.
2. Click on **File** → **Load private key**.
3. Change the view to show all files, select your `id_rsa` file.
4. Click on **File** → **Save private key** to save it in `.ppk` format.

Now, you can use this `.ppk` file in WinSCP as described above.

Remember, the `id_rsa` file must be kept secure as it contains your private SSH key used for authentication. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
