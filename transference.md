- Transference is a psychological phenomenon in which a person's feelings, thoughts, or attitudes towards one person are redirected and transferred onto another person. It is commonly seen in the relationship between a parent and child, but can also occur in any interpersonal relationship. Transference can have both positive and negative effects on the relationship, depending on the nature of the emotions being transferred. Positive transference can result in increased trust and closeness, while negative transference can lead to anxiety, fear, anger, and other negative emotions. In therapy, transference is often used as a tool to help patients explore their own thoughts and feelings about themselves and others.
