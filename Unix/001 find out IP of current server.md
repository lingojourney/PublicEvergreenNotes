To find out the IP address of your current server in a Unix-based system, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
hostname -I
```

This command will display all network interfaces' IP addresses. If you're looking for the public IP address, you might need to use a service like `curl` with an external service:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

This will return the public IP address of your server as seen from the internet². Remember that `hostname -I` will give you the local IP addresses assigned to your server, which might be different from the public IP address if your server is behind a router or a firewall².
