In Unix-like operating systems, when chaining commands, the double ampersands `&&` and the semicolon `;` serve different purposes:

- The double ampersands `&&` are used to run the second command **only if** the first command completes successfully (i.e., returns an exit status of zero). This is known as **short-circuit evaluation**. For example:
  ```bash
  command1 && command2
  ```
  Here, `command2` will only execute if `command1` succeeds¹.

- The semicolon `;`, on the other hand, is used to separate commands, so that the second command runs **regardless** of the success or failure of the first command. For instance:
  ```bash
  command1; command2
  ```
  In this case, `command2` will execute after `command1` has finished, irrespective of `command1`'s exit status².

So, if you want to ensure that a sequence of commands only continues if each previous command is successful, use `&&`. If you want to run a list of commands sequentially without considering their exit statuses, use `;`.
