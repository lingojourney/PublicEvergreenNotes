To display the current date and time in Unix, you can use the `date` command. Here's a simple command to get the current date and time:

```bash
date
```

This will output the current date and time based on your system's timezone settings.

If you want to format the output, you can use the `+` option with format specifiers. For example, to display the current date and time in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, you can use:

```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

Here are some common format specifiers you might find useful:
- `%Y`: Year (e.g., `2024`)
- `%m`: Month (01-12)
- `%d`: Day of the month (01-31)
- `%H`: Hour (00-23)
- `%M`: Minute (00-59)
- `%S`: Second (00-60)

You can combine these to create a custom date-time string that suits your needsÂ¹Â². If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
