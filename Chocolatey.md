To list all installed Chocolatey packages, you can use the command:

```shell
choco list 
```

And to update all your Chocolatey packages, you can use:

```shell
choco upgrade all -y
```

The `-y` flag automatically confirms that you want to perform the action without prompting for confirmation.

For automation, you can create a scheduled task to run this command periodically. [There’s also a Chocolatey package called `choco-upgrade-all-at`, which can be used to schedule upgrades at a time that suits you](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date). [Additionally, the `choco-upgrade-all-at-startup` package can be installed to upgrade all packages on startup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date).

[Remember to ensure that your machine is on AC power if you’re using a laptop, as the scheduled task may not run on battery power](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24579193/how-do-i-automatically-keep-all-locally-installed-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date).
