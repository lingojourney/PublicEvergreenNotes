In Obsidian, a popular note-taking application that allows users to build a personal knowledge management system, the `{<!--SR:!2024-06-30,1,230-->}` tag is used with the Spaced Repetition plugin. This tag is employed to manage review schedules for particular pieces of information, adhering to the principles of spaced repetition, a learning technique that increases the intervals of time between reviews of previously learned material to boost memory retention and recall. Hereâ€™s how the components of the tag break down:

- **2024-06-30**: This is the date when the next review is scheduled.
- **1**: This is the interval in days until the next review after the one on June 30, 2024. It indicates how many days later the content should be reviewed again if the June 30 review is successful.
- **230**: This number is a bit more ambiguous without specific context from the plugin's documentation or settings, but typically it might represent a unique identifier for the note or the repetition sequence number.

This system allows Obsidian users to systematically review and reinforce their knowledge over time, leveraging spaced repetition directly within their note-taking environment.
