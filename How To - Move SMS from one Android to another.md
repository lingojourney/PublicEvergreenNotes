1. Install SMS Backup & Restore App: This app is available on Google Play Store. Download and install it on both your old and new Android phones.

2. Backup SMS on Old Android Phone: Open the app on your old phone, tap on "Backup". Select "Text Messages" and then choose where to store the backup file - Google Drive, Dropbox, or your phone’s internal storage.

3. Transfer Backup File to New Android Phone: If you've stored the backup file in the cloud (Google Drive or Dropbox), just download it onto your new phone. If you’ve stored it in your old phone’s internal storage, connect both phones to a PC and manually copy the file from one phone to the other.

4. Restore SMS on New Android Phone: On your new phone, open the SMS Backup & Restore app, tap on “Restore”, select the backup file you've just transferred, and then tap “Restore” again.

Remember:

- Make sure that both of your Android phones are connected to a stable Wi-Fi network during this process.
- You may need to set SMS Backup & Restore as your default messaging app temporarily for this process.
- Both devices should have enough battery life for this process or be plugged in.
